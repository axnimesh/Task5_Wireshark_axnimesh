# Wireshark Packet Capture - Task 5

## Objective
To capture live network traffic and identify different protocols.

## Steps
- Installed and launched Wireshark.
- Captured live packets for 1 minute.
- Visited websites and pinged servers to generate traffic.
- Filtered packets by protocols.

## Protocols Identified
1. **DNS** – Used for resolving domain names.
2. **HTTP/HTTPS** – Web browsing traffic.
3. **TCP** – Underlying transport protocol for reliable data transfer.
4. **ICMP** – Used in ping operations.

## Findings
- DNS queries show IP resolution for visited websites.
- HTTP packets show GET requests and responses.
- ICMP packets confirm connectivity with external servers.

## File Included
- `network_capture.pcapng`
- Screenshots of filtered views
